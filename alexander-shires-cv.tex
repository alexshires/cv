My research involved searching for new fundamental particles by measuring once-in-a-billion signals hidden in background noise. 
To extract the data, I used in-memory and batch processing workflows to process datasets of trillions of items with sizes of several petabytes. 
I analysed the data by applying machine learning algorithms to separate signal events from background noise as well as using visualisation software to explore the data. 
As a result, I have discovered several new effects and written several scientific papers based on my results. 
Additionally, I have designed, implemented and maintained scientific software in Python and C++ at both user-level and for production systems with hundreds of users.
As part of an international collaboration, I have worked in small teams located remotely across the UK, Germany,
France and Switzerland. I have managed small teams of researchers and I have coaching skills developed through the
supervision of post-graduate students. Communication of my work is a vital part of itâ€™s success and I have strong
public presentation skills, developed while leading discussions at a number of top academic institutions across
Europe. 
As a convenor of a research working group, I was responsible for around thirty researchers, ranging from students to senior scientific management.

%I extracted the signal using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, boosted decision trees and neural networks as well as utilising visualisation software for data exploration.
%I constructed multi-dimensional models to extract the underlying parameters from the data and published the results in scientific papers.

\cvitem{}{\normalsize\textbf{Lead analyst}: \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6482}{\textit{arXiv:1406.6482}}. Our task was to test two rare signals, one of which had not previously been modelled. As the project lead for a small team, I developed new models to describe the data, implemented all the calculations in a coherent framework and delivered the project. As a result, we achieved a 50\% increase in precision for the result and the paper is one of the highest profile results from the LHCb collaboration.}
%\cvitem{}{\normalsize\textbf{Analyst}: \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.5279}{\textit{arXiv:1210.5279}}. After discovering a possible bias inherent the data from the previous project, I showed that this would create a significant problem for future datasets. To solve this, I researched and developed a mathematical model sufficient to remove the bias and applied it to the data as a proof-of-concept result.}
\cvitem{}{\normalsize\textbf{Analyst}: \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6325}{\textit{arXiv:1304.6325}}. As part of a small team working on one of the top three projects for the LHCb collaboration, I developed and maintained a correction algorithm to translate the recorded, distorted data into the true data. Measurements of the rare signal decay could indicate hidden effects and this algorithm was critical to ensure the accuracy of the final measurement. As a result, we were able to make the world's best measurement with the data available.}

%\section{Professional experience}
%\cvitem{}{As part of a small team, I lead the search to measure the difference between two rare particle decays. I joined the project and was asked to implement new models to distinguish the signal from the background noise. I researched and developed new models which increased the precision on the measurement from 25\% to under 10\% which enabled us to achieve our target goal for the project. Whilst located in Germany, I presented to key stakeholders in Geneva as well as working with and coaching a student in Bristol. As a result, we delivered the most precise calculation in the world and our result has opened up new avenues of research.}
%
%\cvitem{}{As project coordinator, I lead a small team to measure one of the rarest particle decays in the world. Our task was to update the previous measurement with three times more data as well as measure several new quantities. As the team was spread across three countries, I used a variety of different communication methods to ensure the team worked effectively. Additionally, I coached a student and provided them with frameworks and tools in order to enable us to meet internal deadlines. 
%I used my networks to bring in additional expertise to enable us to add further value to the project and as a result, we surpassed our targets for the project.}
%
%\cvitem{}{I have worked as part of the software team to develop the data processing software for the LHCb experiment at CERN. This software is required to reduce the rate of input data from 1MHz to 300kHz whilst ensuring that all the signal events are kept and background noise is rejected. As this software is critical for data taking, I have tasked to measure the performance of the software twice, in preparation for data taking in 2011 and 2015. As a result, we have recorded enough quality data to the ensure the high value of LHCbâ€™s physics program.}
